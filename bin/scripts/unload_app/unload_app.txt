unload_app.vbs clears the IIS application cache for all site on a 
given server.  This is the same as clicking the UNLOAD button on the 
home tab within a site's properties; but this is for ALL sites on
the servername passed to the script.

Output is friendly and lists the web site name (comment) for each site.

Usage:

cscript unload_app.vbs servername
